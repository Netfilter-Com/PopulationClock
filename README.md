Population Clock is an iOS tool for learning about geography and demographics.

Download app on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/population-clock-hd/id590689957)

____
The project uses the most recent data from these two trusted sources:

- [World Development Indicators - The World Bank](http://databank.worldbank.org/)
- [The World Factbook - CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/)

____
Besides the iOS app, there are a few Python scripts to execute the following actions:

- Scrape the country descriptions and energy production from the World Factbook.
- Download the most recent indicators from World Databank using their JSON API (Some updates are quarterly and others yearly).
- Generate plist file with all indicators and descriptions to use with Xcode.
- With population growth data, create colored SVG map.
- Generate 8-bit greyscale map with one color per country. This allows us to identify which country was clicked by reading the color of the selected pixel.
